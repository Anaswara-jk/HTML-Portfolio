<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a forward-thinking entrepreneur and developer with a passion for creating 
  AI-powered, user-centric platforms that address meaningful needs in wellness and 
  education. Through projects like WellNest and an AI-based music tutor platform, I 
  aim to blend technology with real-life benefits, helping users improve their health 
  and learning experiences in ways that feel intuitive and impactful.</p>

<p>My technical expertise spans full-stack development, from frontend frameworks like 
  React and Angular to backend systems with Node.js and Django, along with AI/ML tools
  like TensorFlow and PyTorch. I prioritize personalized experiences, real-time feedback, 
  and community engagement in my work, focusing on what truly enhances the user experience.</p>

<p>I'm driven to make a positive impact, using a combination of innovation, technical 
  precision, and a deep understanding of user needs to design solutions that empower 
  people to take charge of their well-being, learning, and personal growth in meaningful, 
  connected ways.</p>
